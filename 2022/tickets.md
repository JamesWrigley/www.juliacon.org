# JuliaCon 2022: Registration

Tickets will be free, but registration is required to access the conference.
Free registration will give you access to all the workshops and talks. We also ask that if you have the means, you
"buy" a ticket which will serve as a donation to the project. Donations are not required but they support, among other things,
the infrastructure to test, build, and ship Julia, and initiatives like
Julia Summer of Code, D&I, and the Julia Community Prize!
