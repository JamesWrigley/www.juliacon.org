# Diversity Scholarship

For JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023, we are offering scholarship opportunities, including networking events with our sponsoring companies, to individuals from underrepresented groups who might otherwise face barriers to attending the conference.

One of our primary objectives at JuliaCon Local Eindhoven 2023 is to promote awareness and enthusiasm for opportunities in software engineering and data analytics among underrepresented groups. To enhance diversity in the field of scientific computing, our outreach program spans a range of activities, from organizing workshops that introduce programming to young women to actively encouraging diversity among our conference speakers.

* Please note that the scholarships do not cover travel and accommodation expenses; they include only a full day conference pass.
