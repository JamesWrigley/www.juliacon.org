## How to submit to a minisymposium

Minisymposia accepting submissions are tracks in the pretalx system. Simply choose the minisymposium from the
"tracks" field when submitting.

By default, deadline for minisymposia is the same of JuliaCon. Some minisymposia organizers may choose to extend the deadline after this has passed. This will be communicated later.
