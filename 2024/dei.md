JuliaCon 2024 will attempt provide financial assistance to those who wish to attend but for whom it is financially infeasible. A portion of sponsorship money will be set aside for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, including providing free tickets and travel assistance to diverse attendees. Awards are based on financial need, benefits to the applicant, and contributions by the applicant to their community and the broader Julia community. Financial assistance cannot be guaranteed at this time, but we will do what we can.

**Please apply for a Diversity Scholarship of Speaker Funding [here](https://forms.gle/CvwRDuLV4C2Tfmxs9).** More information on the programs and the funding available is in the form descrription. 

We will begin reviewing applications immediately once speakers are announced. After that, we will still accept applications until **April 1st, 2024**, but we will prioritize applications that are submitted before the speakers are announced, so please submit your application as soon as possible.

We plan to have on-site childcare at JuliaCon 2024 for children between the ages of 0-12. When you purchase your ticket there is an option to sign up for one of the available JuliaCare childcare slots! We hope that this will allow increased attendance and participation from parents of young children. As we approach the conference those who signed up will be contacted with more details.

The childcare providers will speak Dutch and English.
