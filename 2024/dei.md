# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at JuliaCon 2024

## Ticket and Travel Grants

JuliaCon 2024 will attempt provide financial assistance to those who wish to attend but for whom it is financially infeasible. A portion of sponsorship money will be set aside for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, including providing free tickets and travel assistance to diverse attendees. Priority will be given to speakers, so please submit a proposal to speak even if you arenâ€™t sure of the financial feasibility of attending right now.

Financial assistance cannot be guaranteed at this time, but we will do what we can.

## Childcare

We plan to have on-site childcare at JuliaCon 2024 for children between the ages of 0-6. We are still working out the details, but there will be an option when purchasing a ticket to sign your child up for one of the available JuliaCare slots! We hope that this will allow increased attendance and participation from parents of young children
