# Accessibility at JuliaCon

JuliaCon is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive environment to every attendee.
In light of the on-going pandemic and need to shift JuliaCon online, our accessibility plans for this year are likely to be very different from prior events.

We will strive to ensure that the online platforms are compatible with screen
readers, and we shall attempt to close caption all our talks.

Please reach out to the organising committee at \email for any additional concerns.

# Presentation Templates

As we are aiming to raise diversity awareness and promote equity for all members of our community, we have some guidelines and advice for all people making presentations as we want to reach everybody in the audience, despite of vision impairment, color blindness or any other disability. If you are a presenter, keep in mind that these are recommendations to make your presentations and posters more inclusive! Feel free to reach out for questions:

### Diversity Awareness:

Be aware and open to the diversity in your audience. When planning your content understand that
some of your audience might not be able to:
- See well or at all,
- Hear well or at all,
- Move well or at all,
- Speak well or at all,
- Process information in certain formats well or at all.
**_Your audience has both visible and invisible identities and accessibility needs._**

#### Best practices for creating an accessible PowerPoint:

- Use a simple sans serif font (e.g. Ariel, Veranda, Helvetica)
- Use a 28 point or larger type. Here is a suggestion for formatting:
  - **Title Text:** Arial 40, bold, centered
  - **Section Headings**, (narrative text), Arial 36, bold, left-justified
  - **Main text** (narrative text), Arial 36, plain, left-justified
- On the intro slide provide a link to your presentation so participants can follow along on their
personal devices. _Consider using a QR code for fast access_.

To generate a QR Code for your presentation, we recommend: [Thonky](https://www.thonky.com/qrcode/).

- Each slide should have a title for screen reader navigation. Slide titles do not have to be visible on the slide.
- Minimize the amount of text on slides.
-  Do not use color as the only method for distinguishing information, particularly on charts and
graphs. Communicate data in both color and text.
- Make graphics as simple as possible.
- Provide alt-text for all images: [adding alt-text in PowerPoint.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/video-improve-image-accessibility-in-powerpoint-2e7fdfc4-1fa5-4092-be4b-8a4ca592197c)
- Check your presentation for accessibility using the built-in PowerPoint Accessibility Checker.

#### Best practices for inclusive presentations:

-  Allow plenty of time for participants to read a slide. Cover all the visual information on the slide. Try to use the ratio of one slide _per_ minute.
- Describe all images, graphs and charts.
-  Provide a brief description of videos in advance of playing.
-  Remember potential accessibility issues with participation activities including question and answer periods. Use a microphone if available and always repeat the question so everyone can hear.
