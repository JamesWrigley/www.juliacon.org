## Roles

### On the day volunteers

JuliaCon volunteers are the backbone of our conference and without people like you, we would not be able to make JuliaCon the success it is!

ðŸ‘· Example volunteer duties:
- Check-in at registration desk 
- Ensure talks start and end on time
- Answer or appropriately redirect questions from attendees and speakers
- Appropriately redirect any Code of Conduct complaints
- Manage maximum room capacity
- Helping with any ad hoc needs

**Please note: we are asking that you devote about 50% of your time at the conference helping with any of the tasks that need to be done.**

### Mentors to new speakers

JuliaCon 2024 will match first-time JuliaCon speakers desiring guidance to experienced speakers willing to mentor.
We are expecting a time commitment of maximally a few hours in which mentors will provide feedback on a novice speaker's presentation.

Please let us know if you would like to be mentored or if you are willing to mentor a first-time speaker for JuliaCon 2024!

### Proceedings reviewers

JuliaCon will be offering proceedings, and we need reviewers to assess submissions.
Our review process will be similar to that of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
