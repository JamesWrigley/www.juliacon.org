We invite you to submit proposals to give a talk at JuliaCon 2022.

JuliaCon has traditionally had talks that ranged from introductory to advanced, on topics related to various fields, and from developers and researchers from industry and academia. If you have worked on Julia in the past, JuliaCon is the best venue to share your work with the Julia community.

To get a feel for previous years’ presentations, take a look at our past programs and recordings: ([2014](https://juliacon.org/2014), [2015](https://juliacon.org/2015), [2016](https://juliacon.org/2016), [2017](https://juliacon.org/2017), [2018](https://juliacon.org/2018), [2019](https://juliacon.org/2019), [2020](https://juliacon.org/2020), and [2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/)). 

We are interested to hear about all topics that have to do with Julia. Examples of such topics are:

- Biology, bioinformatics, health, medicine, and health disparities
- Data analytics and visualization
- Finance and economics
- General computing
- Industrial applications
- Julia’s compiler, tooling, and ecosystem
- Numerical and mathematical optimization
- Scientific computing
- Software engineering best practices
- Statistics, machine learning, and AI
- Computational humanities and social science

The most important consideration is whether the topic would be interesting to the Julia community.

# Proposal Types
This year, we will have 6 different types under which you can submit proposals. All presentations are expected to be pre-recorded and submitted by early July (exact date to be announced later). Workshops and Birds of Feather sessions are expected to be live. For the first time, this year we will be accepting proposals which are not in English. See below for further details.

### Talks
This track is primarily dedicated to sharing your technical work with the Julia community, whether it is related to software development, research, or applications from a specific field.
	
- **Talks** are 30 minutes long, including 5 minutes allocated for questions from the audience.
- **Lightning talks** are 10 minutes long, including 2 minutes allocated for audience questions.
- This year, you may choose to give your talk in English, another language, or both English and another language.

### Minisymposia
A minisymposium is a “conference-within-a-conference” where the organizers are responsible for scheduling speakers, panels, and discussions as they see fit. Organizers of a minisymposium are also expected to provide a moderator or chair for the session. A minisymposium is allocated a two to three hour slot. *Note:* In contrast to JuliaCon 2021, minisymposia will be scheduled before the official start date of the conference, along side the workshops.

### Workshops
A workshop is usually a three hour interactive hands-on session where the presenter live codes in front of the audience and shares code with attendees to allow them to follow easily.  Workshops will take place before the official start date of the conference. Example topics on this track include package-specific tutorials or field-specific tutorials. *Note:* since this is the first year JuliaCon will be accepting proposals for workshops not in English, try to keep level of the workshop introductory if you wish to propose a non-English workshop.

### Virtual Posters
Since JuliaCon2022 is a fully online conference this year, poster presenters will not prepare physical posters. Instead, they will be asked to provide 3 minute recordings of their proposed topics. Videos will then be used in dedicated chat rooms where attendees who join the room can quickly watch the video and join the conversation about the video or topic presented.

### Birds of a Feather / Interest groups
Birds of feather sessions are breakout sessions for organized discussions around specific topics. For example, package maintainers can use these times to organize a meeting with and recruit contributors, or community members can organize discussion groups for Julia teaching materials or diversity recruitment. These sessions will be allocated a one hour timeslot, and will not be recorded.

### Experiences
The purpose of this track is to welcome new members in the community. Example topics include your favorite features in Julia, how Julia has helped you solve a certain problem, an interesting problem you solved with Julia in a university class, or, more generally, how Julia has been a good addition to your workflow. These presentations will each last three minutes and will be interspersed throughout different sessions in the conference. We encourage you to show contact information such as twitter handle or github handle or email on your slides if you’d welcome any offline questions, as there won’t be allocated time for questions in this track. We especially welcome newcomers to Julia to share their impressions with the community using this track. If you are a teacher or professor using Julia in your teaching, we encourage you to invite your students to apply to share their experiences with the Julia community.

When submitting your proposal (abstract), you may select multiple categories for consideration.

# Submission details

We are using an anonymized submissions process, to avoid selection bias related to the speaker. While enforcing double blind is impossible since most submissions should link to public open source code, all efforts are made to ensure impartial review of submissions. If you are submitting a proposal for a non-English session, you may submit in the language of your choice. In addition please always provide an English version of your proposal (a machine translation is completely fine!). We will always attempt to find fluent speakers of your chosen language to review your proposal. However, in case this is not possible, we will fall back to the English translation in order to submit it to a wider reviewer pool. In case you choose to present in a different language than English, please note this in the abstract itself (e.g. "This workshop will be presented in Thai." or "I will be giving a Julia Experiences talk in Czech.").

If you are submitting a workshop or birds-of-a-feather session that you think would particularly benefit from being held at a certain time, please note this in your proposal. For example, if you would like to present a workshop in Mandarin, and want it to be held at a time convenient for attendees in Asia, indicate this in your abstract.

### Recordings and materials

JuliaCon 2022 will be an online conference, and to facilitate the planning of the conference, we will ask our speakers to submit a recorded version of their talk before the conference, and we plan to make all recorded material publicly available after the conference. If, for any reason, you prefer that your video remain private please contact us at juliacon@julialang.org. Finally, we also ask you to make your materials and recording available under a Creative Commons (default: no commercial reuse) or other open source license. If you would like to give your talk in English and another language, we will ask you to submit two recorded versions (one in each language). 

#### Transcripts

In order to improve accessibility, we will require transcripts as part of your submission. Keep your eyes on your e-mail for details on the submission process.


### Proceeding Publications

This year we are offering willing participants the chance to have their work published as part of a JuliaCon proceedings publication. More details forthcoming.

### Registration for speakers

We expect our speakers to register for the conference. Note that since JuliaCon 2022 is an entirely online conference, registration will be free.

### How to contact us

You can reach us with questions and concerns at juliacon@julialang.org.

# Appendix

## Review Guidelines and Process

For reference, below are the guidelines and processes that readers will use in reviewing your submission.

The role of reviewers is to ensure the quality of the content presented at JuliaCon.

## Conflict of interest

In any case of conflict of interest, the reviewer commits to withdraw from a review and signal it to the organizers to find a replacement quickly. No reviewer should enter a review on any talk in which they are an author or have another form of conflict of interest. See the [PNAS guidelines](https://www.pnas.org/page/authors/conflict-of-interest) for a definition and examples. Conflicts of interest include any work or authors with which the reviewer has "any association that poses or could be perceived as a financial or intellectual conflict of interest" (PNAS guidelines above).

## Code of Conduct

The reviewer commits to reading and respecting the conference [Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc) in the assessment and all communications during the review process.

If a submitted abstract does not comply with the Code of Conduct, the reviewer should refer it to the organizing committee.

## Criteria for the reviews

Failure to meet these criteria will result in lower scores.

1. The abstract should be easy to read and understandable for someone not working on the same topic. The title should make it easy to identify the topic of the content.

2. The abstract presented should be technically sound to the best of the reviewer's knowledge.

3. The subject should be of interest for JuliaCon, including but not limited to the topics listed on the [Call for Proposals](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2021/cfp)

- Biology, bioinformatics, health, medicine, and health disparities
- Data analytics and visualization
- Finance and economics
- General computing
- Industrial applications
- Julia’s compiler, tooling, and ecosystem
- Numerical and mathematical optimization
- Scientific computing
- Software engineering best practices
- Statistics, machine learning, and AI
- Computational humanities and social science

4. If the format requested by the author (experience, lightning talk, talk, workshop, poster, minisymposium, birds-of-a-feather) does not seem appropriate, the reviewer can signal it and suggest another one.

5. Use cases of Julia in an enterprise environment are in general of interest to the conference. In particular, feedback on product development using or interacting with Julia and its ecosystem are welcome. However, talks and posters are not a suitable venue for product placement.

## Scoring Criteria

The following are the criteria by which scores (1-5) should be given:

1. Applicability to the Julia community. Would users of Julia be interested in this talk for either its methods or its results? Higher scoring proposals should be of wide interest to Julia users.

2. Contributions to the community. Is this a new package for people to use? Higher scoring proposals should be code or ideas that others can use.

3. Clarity. What is the purpose of this talk? What will people learn? Higher scoring proposals should be clear as to their purpose.

4. Significance to the community. Is this something that will change the way a lot of other people use Julia or its package ecosystem? Higher scoring proposals should be more significant to Julia users. Note that this does not require scientific significance, just significance as a software or tutorial to users of Julia.

5. Topic diversity. As a community we value the diversity of applications. Proposals which are targeting new areas and fields for the Julia community to expand should be given some credit.

6. Soundness. Proposals should be technically sound. Glaring incorrectness should be highlighted and taken into account.

7. Classification. The criteria will be stricter for longer presentations.

## Review Process

- The workshop proposals will be curated by the program committee. All of the workshop proposers with proposals meeting a certain level of scrutiny will be contacted and a coherent workshop schedule will be decided on based on these submissions.

- Talks, Lightning Talks, Posters, and Minisymposia will be judged together in two rounds. In the first round, all reviewers will be given a selection of X many proposals to review, such that every proposal gets 3 reviews. Every review should include a score and a comment, at least a 1 sentence overview of their thoughts on the proposal. If any reviewers dropped out, we will have a second round to add more reviewers to those proposals by re-distributing to the active reviewers. After this round, the committee will ensure that each proposal has had 3 reviews.

- After the two review stages is the selection stage. The top proposals will be accepted and the bottom proposals will be rejected or re-classified and counted as a middle proposal. All proposals in the middle will then be marked for extra consideration. The amount of "top proposals" to be considered for stage 1 selection is dependent on the number of available speaker slots vs the number of proposals, and generally is reserved for average scores of 4+ without any comments of concern.

- In the second selection stage, the review committee will take the reviewer scores, comments, and re-classifications to decide the final acceptances. Rejected proposals will be discussed for re-classification before a full rejection.

- After all proposals have been classified, acceptances and rejections will be released.

- A special symposium for Google Summer of Code student lightning talks will be reserved. This is kept for later in the process since the approval/rejection of proposals is BEFORE GSoC students are accepted. These proposals will be directly reviewed by the review committee.

## Review Comments

Each review should include a comment that justifies the scores that were given. For example, a comment may be like: 

- "This proposal is clear, a very new application of Julia (to me), and it introduces a new package which I think many may find useful"

- "While it seems to be state-of-the-art, the closedness and cost of the software makes the talk seem only targeted at a small enterprise audience and not of general Julia user interest. If the proposal focused more on their experience using Julia rather than their product, I would have seen it as more applicable to this conference".
